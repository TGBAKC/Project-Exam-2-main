# 🌍 Holidaze - Accommodation Booking Platform

![Screenshot](image.png)

Holidaze is a modern, responsive accommodation booking web application developed as part of my final exam project in frontend development. This application serves both a **customer-facing side**—allowing users to browse and book holiday venues—and an **admin-facing side**—enabling venue managers to register, manage venues, and handle bookings.
